  <h1>"A Hand-Made Wallet"</h1>
  <p>
    An ill child was brought to a hospital. After her treatment, the mother showed the doctor a hand-made wallet and said:
  </p>
  <dd>
    "There are things we can't pay. I hope you take this wallet I made for you."
  </dd>
  <p>The doctor said:</p>
  <dd>
    "I don't practice for sentimental reasons. Pay me P10000."
  </dd>
  <p>
    The lady opened the wallet, took out P50000, and gave the doctor P10000. Then she replied:
  </p>
  <dd>
    "You are a very good doctor, but I wish you were a better person."
