            I knelt to pray but not for long,
            I had too much to do.
            I had to hurry and get to work
            For bills would soon be due.

            So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,
            And jumped up off my knees.
            My Christian duty was now done
            My soul could rest at ease.

            All day long I had no time
            To spread a word of cheer.
            No time to speak of Christ to friends,
            They'd laugh at me I'd fear.

            No time, no time, too much to do,
            That was my constant cry,
            No time to give to souls in need
            But at last the time, the time to die.

            I went before the Lord,
            I came, I stood with downcast eyes.
            For in his hands God held a book;
            It was the book of life.

            God looked into his book and said
            "Your name I cannot find.
            I once was going to write it down...
            But never found the time"
